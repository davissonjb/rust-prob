# Repository:: rust-prob
Re-write of (C++) prob-stats repository in Rust, as idiomatically as possible.

## Background::
This repository, as aforementioned, is a recreation of a previous work. 
That original work was done in C++ during the semester I sat for the
engineering probability/statistics course.
